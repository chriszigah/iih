    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>
      Headings define the outline of your site. THer are sixe levels of headings
    </p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unorderd list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add "ul" element (it stands for unorderd list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "lli" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- (This is bad!) -->
    <ul>
      <p>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</p>
    </ul>
    <!-- (Do this instead) -->
    <ul>
      <li><p>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>
        You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an
        ordered list
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p>
      <em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or
      phrase.
    </p>
    <!-- (Again, don't ever do this) -->
    <!-- <p>This is some <em>emphasized text</p></em> -->

    <p>
      Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance
      of a word or phrase.
    </p>
    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    <!-- (You will be shunned for this) -->
    <p>This paragraph needs some space below it...</p>
    <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
    <p>So, I added some hard line breaks.</p>

      P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS
      soon.
    </p>
    optional trailing slash The trailing slash (/) in all empty HTML elements is
    entirely optional. The above snippet could also be marked up like this (note
    the lack of / in the <br />
    and
    <hr />
    tags):
